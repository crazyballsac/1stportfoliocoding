This quarter of ICT is pretty fun. We are getting much deeper into coding which makes me interested since I've liked coding for a while now. The performance tasks are very fun too to say the least. There are just some things I dont enjoy that much and those are quizzes. Some terms being asked there are pretty confusing even though they seem easy. I tend to overthink quite a lot so that is a bad habit I need to fix immideately. Other than that i dont really find anything else unenjoyable. <br> <br>

As for time-limited hands ons, they are very exciting. They kind of force you to lock in since you have only 45 minutes to finish your output (or even less time than that). All the lessons are also pretty cool though because for example, XHTML taught me something I didn't even know HTML ever had (like the use of an empty tag with a slash a front to represent closing). Lists and tables overall seem pretty simple since its just a few things you need to be familiar with and understand. That is until you get to nested lists which are pretty awkward at first, but once you think about it, it starts to make sense. Hyperlinks are also pretty easy to understand. You just cover up content with the "a" tag and add href for the target and you're done. <br> <br> 
One thing i can say for sure is that I would definitely be able to apply this for my future activities. Most of the stuff discussed in this quarter is a very big foundation for content layout. XHTML for preparation to stricter coding, Lists and tables for better layouts, Links for navigation, Forms for better interaction and a way for data input. <br> <br>
Overall I learned quite a lot in this first quarter and I am going to apply the things I learned in the future. This quarter is also really fun for me.
